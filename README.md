#PoC Facebook login & subscribed

Proof of concept to check login with manage_pages permissons in Facebook.

* To start:
  * `npm install && npm start`

This example, use [test2 Facebook App](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/255986568181021/dashboard/) and _Helen Alagcefjffgfc Seligsteinescu_ [Test Users in Roles app](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/255986568181021/roles/test-users/)

* To test all flow, first delete test2 app permissions in _Helen_ :
![delete app permissions](./src/img/deletePermissions.png)


 1. Login with Helen credentials, show with grant permissions:
  1. ![login](./src/img/login.png)

  2. Grant permissions:
      * ![profile permissions](./src/img/profilePermissions.png)

      * ![page permissions](./src/img/pagePermissions.png)

 2. Check login status and get access_token:

 ![login status](./src/img/loginStatus.png)

 3. Show the Helen's Pages (page-id, user-tokens and perms):

 ![show pagtes](./src/img/pageList.png)

 4. Show page name:

 ![page name](./src/img/pageName.png)

 5. **Get Page Access** This point probably fail, I do **[this](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/access-tokens)**
`GET /{page-id}?fields=access_token`
 With JavaScript SDK:
 ```JavaScript
 FB.api(
      "/229554640867563?fields=access_token",
     function (response) {
       if (response && !response.error) {
         console.log(response);
       }
     }
 );
 ```
And this is the response:

  ![page token response](./src/img/pageTokenResponse.png)

 But on the final call to **[subscribed](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/subscribed_apps)** which need the page-token obtained before fails:

 ![page subscribed fail](./src/img/pageSubscribed.png)

### I Opened [facebook bug](https://developers.facebook.com/bugs/1928544617392510/) and [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#code)



 ### Important

 [Permissions and App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions#reference-manage_pages)

Your app needs manage_pages and publish_pages permissions from the person who wants to post or message as a page. If your app request these permissions, then your app needs to go through Login Review.

**Your app might not need to request these permissions because people posting are already set up with a role in your app's dashboard.** If this is the case you do not need to submit your app for review. See the Roles tab in App Dashboard.
